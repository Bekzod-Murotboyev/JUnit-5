# JUnit 5

---

- *In this article, we will learn about JUnit 5 and how to use it!*
- *JUnit 5 is composed of several different modules from three different sub-projects.*
    * `JUnit 5 = JUnit Platform + JUnit Jupiter + JUnit Vintage`
    * ****The JUnit Platform*** serves as a foundation for [launching testing frameworks](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#launcher-api) on the JVM.*
    * ****JUnit Jupiter*** is the combination of the programming model and extension model for writing tests and extensions in JUnit 5. The Jupiter sub-project provides a TestEngine for running Jupiter based tests on the platform.*
    * ****JUnit Vintage*** provides a TestEngine for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 based tests on the platform. It requires JUnit 4.12 or later to be present on the class path or module path.*
- *JUnit 5 requires Java 8 (or higher) at runtime. However, you can still test code that has been compiled with previous versions of the JDK.*

| @Test                    | Denotes that a method is a test method. Unlike JUnit 4’s @Test annotation, this annotation does not declare any attributes, since test extensions in JUnit Jupiter operate based on their own dedicated annotations. Such methods are inherited unless they are overridden.                                                                                                                                                                    |
 | @ParameterizedTest       | Denotes that a method is a parameterized test. Such methods are inherited unless they are overridden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| @RepeatedTest            | Denotes that a method is a test template for a repeated test. Such methods are inherited unless they are overridden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| @TestFactory             | Denotes that a method is a test factory for dynamic tests. Such methods are inherited unless they are overridden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| @TestTemplate            | Denotes that a method is a template for test cases designed to be invoked multiple times depending on the number of invocation contexts returned by the registered providers. Such methods are inherited unless they are overridden.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| @TestClassOrder          | Used to configure the test class execution order for @Nested test classes in the annotated test class. Such annotations are inherited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| @TestMethodOrder         | Used to configure the test method execution order for the annotated test class; similar to JUnit 4’s @FixMethodOrder. Such annotations are inherited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| @DisplayNameGeneration   | Declares a custom display name generator for the test class. Such annotations are inherited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| @BeforeEach              | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed before each @Test, @RepeatedTest, @ParameterizedTest, or @TestFactory method in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4’s @Before. Such methods are inherited – unless they are overridden or superseded (i.e., replaced based on signature only, irrespective of Java’s visibility rules).                                                                                               |
| @AfterEach               | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed after each @Test, @RepeatedTest, @ParameterizedTest, or @TestFactory method in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4’s @After. Such methods are inherited – unless they are overridden or superseded (i.e., replaced based on signature only, irrespective of Java’s visibility rules).                                                                                                 |
| @BeforeAll               | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed before all @Test, @RepeatedTest, @ParameterizedTest, and @TestFactory methods in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4’s @BeforeClass. Such methods are inherited – unless they are hidden, overridden, or superseded, (i.e., replaced based on signature only, irrespective of Java’s visibility rules) – and must be static unless the "per-class" test instance lifecycle is used.   |
| @AfterAll                | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed after all @Test, @RepeatedTest, @ParameterizedTest, and @TestFactory methods in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4’s @AfterClass. Such methods are inherited – unless they are hidden, overridden, or superseded, (i.e., replaced based on signature only, irrespective of Java’s visibility rules) – and must be static unless the "per-class" test instance lifecycle is used.     |
| @Nested                  | Denotes that the annotated class is a non-static nested test class. On Java 8 through Java 15, @BeforeAll and @AfterAll methods cannot be used directly in a @Nested test class unless the "per-class" test instance lifecycle is used. Beginning with Java 16, @BeforeAll and @AfterAll methods can be declared as static in a @Nested test class with either test instance lifecycle mode. Such annotations are not inherited.               |
| @Tag                     | Used to declare tags for filtering tests, either at the class or method level; analogous to test groups in TestNG or Categories in JUnit 4. Such annotations are inherited at the class level but not at the method level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| @Disabled                | Used to disable a test class or test method; analogous to JUnit 4’s @Ignore. Such annotations are not inherited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| @Timeout                 | Used to fail a test, test factory, test template, or lifecycle method if its execution exceeds a given duration. Such annotations are inherited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| @ExtendWith              | Used to register extensions declaratively. Such annotations are inherited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| @RegisterExtension       | Used to register extensions programmatically via fields. Such fields are inherited unless they are shadowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| @TempDir                 | Used to supply a temporary directory via field injection or parameter injection in a lifecycle method or test method; located in the org.junit.jupiter.api.io package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
